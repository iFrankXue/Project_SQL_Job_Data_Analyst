# Introduction

This is my first 📊 data analysis project with sql, following the steps of the tutorial video "[SQL for Data Analytics - Learn SQL in 4 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA)" uploaded by 👨[Luke Barousse](https://github.com/lukebarousse). 👍 Thanks to this fantastic tutorial video, I steped into the whole process of a project. Meanwhile, I also engaged with SQLite 📊 and PostgreSQL 🐘 with the first time. 

This project mainly focus on the datasets of job market. Keeping eye on data analyst roles, this project explores 💰 top-paying jobs, 🔥 in-demand skills, and where 📈 high demand meets highsalary in data analytics.

# Background

This project analyzes job market data, focusing on data analyst positions. It aims to identify top-paying jobs, valuable skills, and high-demand qualifications to aid job seekers, employers, and educators.

The dataset of this project comes from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)'s [2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/). The CSV files are available at my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XGe4dxWJeZyD6lN8oWD-rC6VJ9Pyb2OT?usp=share_link)

# Tools I Used
Following this tutorial, I enhanced some skills and get some new skills for the first time. For detial, the following tools are engaged in this project:

- **SQL**: The backbone of this project, I used sql as the mian method to fullfill the whole analysis steps. It covers the basic sql knowledges to advanced skills.
- **PostgreSQL**: As it showed in "[2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/)", PostgreSQL is the most popular Database Management Tool. I used PostgreSQL to handle the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: This is the most used coding software in recent years, and with the help of the SQLTools extension, VS Code can make the query experience much more easy and handy.
- **Git & GitHub**: It is important to make version control during programming procedures. Git and GitHub are essential to meet this requirement. 

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed to investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

This step identify the highest-paying roles. I filtered data analyst positions by average yeraly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date::DATE,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **High Compensation for Leadership Roles**: **Director of Analytics, Associate Director - Data Insights**: Leadership positions command higher salaries, reflecting the value placed on strategic oversight and decision-making in analytics.
- **Remote and Flexible Work Arrangements**: Many high-paying roles are listed as "Anywhere" or offer hybrid/remote options, indicating a growing trend towards flexibility in work locations, especially in the tech and data fields.
- **Diverse Industry Applications**: Companies like **Meta, AT&T, Pinterest, and SmartAsset** highlight that data analysis is a critical function across various industries, from social media and telecommunications to financial services and marketing.

### 2. Top Paying Job Skills

The purpose of this query is to find what skills are required fo the top-pyaing Data Analyst jobs. In order to find out this result, I used the result of query 1 as a CTE(Common Table Expression), and then `INNER JOIN` with `skills_job_dim` and `skill_dim`. Finnaly, I can find the top paying jobs related to specific skill name.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023, based on job postings:
***SQL***: Essential across all top-paying jobs with count of 14.
***Python***: Highly valued for data analysis and scripting with abold count of 11.
***Tableau***: Important for data visualization and highly recommended for data analyst with a bold count of 8. Other skills like ***R***, ***Snowflake***, ***Pandas***, and ***Excel*** show varying degrees of demand.
